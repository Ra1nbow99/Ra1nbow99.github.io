            href='https://www.aisingapore.org/'>AI Singapore</a>, and several international research projects. He has
        won more than 15 international research and service <a href='awards.html' target="middle">awards</a> including 6
        ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Awards. He has received a number of international honors including IEEE Fellow
        (class of 2022, through Computer Society), Fellow of Automated Software Engineering (class of 2021), and ACM Distinguished Member (class of 2019).</p>

    <p class="style1"> He has mentored more than a dozen PhD <a href="students.html">students</a> at SMU and many other
        visitors and collaborators. His former PhD students, trainees, and postdocs have secured faculty positions
        (e.g., Zhejiang University, China; Monash University, Australia; University of Melbourne, Australia; Queen's
        University, Canada; Mississippi State University, USA; ITTelkom Surabaya, Indonesia) and employment at high-tech
        industries (e.g., Microsoft, Canada; Schroder Investment Management, Luxembourg; Hudson River Trading,
        Singapore; Veracode, Singapore) around the globe. Aside from mentorship, he has also given many <a
            href="talks.html">invited talks, keynotes, and short courses</a> about software analytics at various
        industrial and academic events around the globe.</p>

    <p class="style1"> Additionally, he has served in more than 30 organizing committees and numerous program committees of research
        conferences including serving as general or program co-chairs of ESEC/FSE 2024, <a
